The study of earthquakes is crucial for understanding the Earth's dynamic nature and mitigating their potential hazards. Seismologists use various instruments, including seismographs, to measure and record seismic waves. By analyzing these recordings, scientists can determine the earthquake's location, magnitude, and focal mechanism. This information helps in assessing the earthquake's impact and developing strategies to minimize damage and protect lives.
