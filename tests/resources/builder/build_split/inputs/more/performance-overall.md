Understanding the patterns and distribution of earthquakes is essential for assessing seismic hazards. Some regions, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire, experience frequent seismic activity due to the convergence of tectonic plates. Other areas may have lower seismicity but can still be susceptible to significant earthquakes. By analyzing historical earthquake data and conducting geological surveys, scientists can identify high-risk zones and implement measures to enhance preparedness.
