Earthquakes are not only important from a scientific perspective but also impact human lives and communities. Governments, organizations, and individuals take measures to increase earthquake preparedness and resilience. This includes educating the public about earthquake safety, conducting drills, retrofitting buildings to withstand seismic forces, and implementing early warning systems that provide valuable seconds to minutes of alert before the shaking arrives.
