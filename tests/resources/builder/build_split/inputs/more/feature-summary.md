Geologists also investigate the causes and effects of earthquakes. They study fault lines, which are fractures in the Earth's crust where most earthquakes occur. By examining the characteristics of faults, geologists can gain insights into the movement of tectonic plates and the forces acting upon them. This knowledge is crucial for assessing seismic hazards in different regions and developing building codes and infrastructure that can withstand earthquakes.
