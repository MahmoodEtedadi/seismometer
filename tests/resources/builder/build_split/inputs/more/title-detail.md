Geology is the scientific study of the Earth, including its composition, structure, and history. It examines the rocks, minerals, and processes that shape our planet. One fascinating aspect of geology is the study of earthquakes, which are natural phenomena characterized by the shaking of the Earth's crust. Earthquakes occur due to the movement of tectonic plates, and they can have significant impacts on the environment and human society.
