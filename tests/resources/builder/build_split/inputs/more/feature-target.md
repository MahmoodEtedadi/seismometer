Earthquakes can have a wide range of consequences. The immediate impact includes ground shaking, which can cause buildings, bridges, and other structures to collapse. It can also trigger landslides and tsunamis in coastal areas. Furthermore, earthquakes can result in long-term effects such as changes in land elevation, groundwater levels, and the formation of new geological features. By studying past earthquakes, geologists can unravel the Earth's geological history.
