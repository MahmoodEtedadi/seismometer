Earthquakes are typically caused by the release of accumulated stress along faults in the Earth's crust. When the stress exceeds the strength of the rocks, it results in the sudden release of energy, leading to seismic waves that propagate through the Earth. These waves cause the ground to shake, and the severity of shaking depends on factors such as the magnitude of the earthquake and the distance from the epicenter.
