Seismic monitoring networks play a vital role in detecting and tracking earthquakes. These networks consist of numerous seismometers strategically placed around the globe to record ground motion. Real-time data from these instruments enable quick identification of earthquake occurrence, determination of its magnitude, and estimation of its effects. This information is crucial for issuing timely warnings and implementing emergency response plans.
