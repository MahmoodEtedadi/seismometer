The study of geology and earthquakes is an ongoing endeavor. Scientists continue to explore the complexities of Earth's interior, the mechanisms driving plate tectonics, and the factors that influence earthquake occurrence. Through interdisciplinary research and technological advancements, our understanding of earthquakes continues to evolve, leading to improved hazard assessment, mitigation strategies, and ultimately, the protection of lives and infrastructure.
